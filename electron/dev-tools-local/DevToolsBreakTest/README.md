# DevTools Break Test

Simple test case to see if DevTools will be able to execute a break in the debugger using `debugger` command in the boot code of the renderer process.

This test case is to illustrate an issue with Electron for users to debug their boot code using a local Dev Tools debugger.

Note: This same issue exists in [Node Webkit](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/) project the last time I tested in mid 2015.
