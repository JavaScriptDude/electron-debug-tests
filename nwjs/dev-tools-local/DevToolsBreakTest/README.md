# DevTools Break Test

Simple test case to see if DevTools will be able to execute a break in the debugger using `debugger` command in the boot code of the nw.js app.

This test case is to illustrate an issue with nw.js for users to debug their boot code using a local Dev Tools debugger.

This issue also exists with [Atom/Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and is likley an upstream issue within chromium.
